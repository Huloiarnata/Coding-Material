Array => It's a data stucture containing a number of data types which are all of same types.

One Dimension Array :-
- Declaring and defining of one dimension Array.
    - syntax=> data_type<array name>[number of elements in the array];
    - the above syntax will also define the array, the compilerwill allocate contigious block 
      of memory of size [num of elements]*sizeof(<datatype>).
    - The length of the array can only be specified by an POSITIVE INTEGER.
    - Always specify the length of the array using macro. This is because if we are going without it 
      then while changing array length we have to change length of the array in every code but 
      with macro we just have to change while declaring macro and the rest will be taken care of.
- Accessing elements from one dimension arrays.
    - syntax array_name[index]
    - 0 to (length-1)
- Initializing one dimension arrays.
    - METHOD-1 (Not preffered)
         - arr[5]={1,2,3,4,5};
    - METHOD-2
         - arr[]={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};
    - METHOD-3 (Not preffered)
         - int arr[3];
           arr[0]=1;
           arr[1]=5;
           arr[2]=7;
    - METHOD-4
         - int arr[5];
           for(int i=0;i<5;i++){
               scanf("%d",arr[i]);
           }
- Designated Initialization in one dimension array.
    - for int a[5]={1,0,3,0,0};
      we can declare it like:
        int a[5]={[0]=1,[2]=3}; // each element in sq bracket is called designator.
    - for int a[]={[0]=12,[4]=2,[2]=56,[56]=185};
        The compiler will deduce the length of the array by largest designator in the list which here is 56.
    - if the index is already acquired by some value and also declared by the designator 
      then designator value will be th final value.
- if the number of elements are less than the number declared then rest of the indeces take value '0'.
- It's illegal to put more elementsthan declared.
- {} this can't be empty it's illegal one element has to be there.

Multidimensional array- array of arrays
Two Dimensional Array :-
- Declaring and defining of one dimension Array.
    - syntax=> data_type<array name>[number of elements in the array row][number of elements in the array column];
