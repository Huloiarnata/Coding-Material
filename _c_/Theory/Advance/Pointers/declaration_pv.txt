Pointer 
        -- Is a variable that stores memory address.
        -- It is called a pointer because it point towards a memory location.
        -- The pointer has to be declared with a name and data type as it also occupies some memory.
Declaration 
        --  data type *pointer_name;
        -- * this tell the compiler that the variable declared is a pointer.
        --  here datatype refer to the base type of the pointer or the type the pointer is pointing at.
        -- almost all pointers occupy same space size.
Assigning address
        -- Global and local static variable are automatically inistialised to null.
        -- automatic pointer holds garbage value.
        -- we can assign null to a pointer of any type this prevents from the pointer pointing toward 
           random memory location.
Derefrencing Pointer variable
        -- %p is the format specifier for printing address.
