for integers modifiers are:
1) long
2) short
3) signed
4) unsigned


=>short and long allows integer to take less and more memory than int but this is not guarented
     sizeof(short int)<=sizeof(int)<=sizeof(long int)
=> signed integer: When declaring integer by default the value is to be signed integer.
   unsigned integer: To declare and integer which will take only positive integer we use-
                     unsigned int <variable-name>;
