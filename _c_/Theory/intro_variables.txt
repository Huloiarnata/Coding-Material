variables => names which point to a memory location
In C lang we have to anounce/declare properties of the variables to the compiler.
data type => how much space a variable is going to occupy in the memory

    int<data_type of the variable> var<name of the variable>;

Initialization => Assigning value at the time of declaration itself is called initialization

    int number = 0;
